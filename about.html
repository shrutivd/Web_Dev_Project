					I have completed earlier education in Electronics when I was in India.
					I have 2 years of experience in software testing. When I came to USA,
					I got admitted to Portland State University for a grad-prep track.
					After completing those 8 courses with good grades, I got admitted to
					masters in the same university. This is my third term. Up until now I
					was exploring and was not sure which graduation track is best fit for
					my interests. But now I am confident to follow the 'software
					engineering' track. I want to be both front end and back-end
					developer. I am choosing my courses keeping that in mind. Experience
					of pursuing masters is filled with fun, challenges, and constant hard
					work.
